**Step 1:** Clone repo from here:  https://github.com/enigma-io/smoke-signals-model  
**Step 2:** Follow Brian's instructions in README to reproduce analysis.  Additional comments below to fill in gaps in this process:  
**Step 3:** Download csv files from Enigma's S3. I'm running this locally on my laptop, so the makeFile with `wget` didn't work.  I downloaded and moved them to the `/data` folder manually  
**Step 4** Knit the document.  output will be saved afterward.  

Note: I'm running and storing this on my local as the data is quite large (~2.7 GB).
